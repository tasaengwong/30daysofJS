# #day 9 Higher Order Function

## Higher Order Function

Are function which take other function as a parameter or return a function

## Callback

A callback is a function with can be passed as parameter to other function

## Example Syntax

         // a callback function, the function could be any name
         const callback = (n) => {
         return n ** 2
         }
         // function take other function as a callback
         function cube(callback, n) {
         return callback(n) * n
         }
         console.log(cube(callback, 3))

# Function Programming

writing regular loop, latest version of JavaScript introduced lots of built in methods which can help us to solve complicated problems. In this section, we will see forEach, map, filter, reduce, find, every, some, and sort.

### ForEach

forEach: Iterate an array elements. We use forEach only with arrays. It takes a callback function with elements,
index parameter and array itself. The index and the array optional.

### Map

Iterate an array elements and modify the array elements. It takes a callback function with elements, index , array parameter and return a new array.

### Filter 

Filter : filter out item which full fill conditions and return a new array

#### Example syntax 
            //Filter countries containing land 
            const countriesContainingLand = countries.filter((country) => country
            includes('land')
            console.log(countriesContainingLand)


# #Day 10 Sets and Map
## Set
    set is collection of elements. Set can only contains unique element.
    
    
### syntax 
            //create an empty set 
            const companies = new set()
            consoloe.log(companies)

### adding an element to a set
            const companies = new Set() // creating an empty set
            console.log(companies.size) // 0

            companies.add('Google') // add element to the set
            companies.add('Facebook')
            companies.add('Amazon')
            companies.add('Oracle')
            companies.add('Microsoft')

            console.log(companies.size) // 5 elements in the set
            console.log(companies)

// using .add for add element to set
### deleting an element a set 
 // can delete an element from element a set using a delete method.
            //syntax example 
            console.log(comoanies.delete('Google'))

### checking an element in the set 
// the has method can help to know if a certain element exists in a set.
            
            console.log(companies.has('Apple')) 
            // false because don't have element Apple in a set
            
and remove all the element from a set using clear().
            companies.clear()


# day 11 Destructuring and Spreading
    Destructuring is a unpack arrays,and object and assigning to a distinct variable.

## Example Destructuring Arrays
            const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
            let [numOne, numTwo, numThree] = numbers

            console.log(numOne, numTwo, numThree)


If we like to skip on of the value in the array we use additional comma.The comma help to omit the value. And we can use default value in case the value of array for that index is undefined.

We can not assign variable to all the element in the array. We can destructure  and we can get the remaining as array using spread operator (...)
### Example 
            const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
            let [num1, num2, num3, ...rest] = nums

            console.log(num1, num2, num3)
            console.log(rest)

We can Destructuring during iteration using for of
### Example 
            const countries = [['Finland', 'Helsinki'], ['Sweden', 'Stockholm']
            ['Norway', 'Oslo']]

            for (const [country, city] of countries) {
            console.log(country, city)
            }

## Destructuring Object
When we destructure the name of the variable we use to destructure should be exactly the same as the key or property of the object.

# Spread or Rest Operator
When we destructure an array we use the spread operator(...) to get the rest elements as array. In addition to that we use spread operator to spread arr elements to another array.
### Example Spread operator to get the rest of array 
            const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
            let [num1, num2, num3, ...rest] = nums
â€‹
            console.log(num1, num2, num3)
            console.log(rest)



# Day 12 Regular Expression 

A regular expression or RegExp is a language that htlp to find pattern in data. A RegExp can be use to check if some pattern exists in different data. To use RegExp in JS either we use RegExp we can declare a RegExp pattern using two forward slashes followed by a flag. we can create a pattern in two ways

## Flags
Flags are optional parameters in regular expression which determine the type of searching. Let see some of the flags
- g : is a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text
- i : case insensitive flag (If searches for both lowercase and uppercase)
- m : multiline

### Creating a pattern with RegExp Constructor 
Declaring regular expression without global flag and case insensitive flag.

            let pattern  = 'love'
            let regEx = new RegExp(pattern)

Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag.

            let pattern = 'love'
            let flag = 'gi'
            let regEx = new RegExp(pattern, flag)

### Creating a pattern without RegExp Constructor
Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag.

            let regEx= /love/gi


### RegExp Object Methods
 - test() : Test for a match in a string. It return true or false
 - match() : Return an array containing all of the matches. If we don't use a global flag, match() return an array and group.
 - search() : Tests for match in string. If return the index of match
 - replace() : Executes a search for a match in a string, and replace the matched substring

 ## Square Bracket
 let's use square bracket to include lower and upper case

            // Example 
            const pattern = '[Aa]pple' // this square bracket mean either A or a
            const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits. An old cliche says an apple a da
            a doctor way has been replaced by a banana a day keeps the doctor far far
            away. '
            const matches = txt.match(pattern)
            
            console.log(matches)  


# Day 13 Console Object Methods
Use console object method to show output in the browser console. And the console method is the most popular testing  and debugging tool on browser. 

- console.log() : using to show  output on the browser console. we can substitute value and also we can style the logging out put 
- console.warn() : use console.warn to give warning on browser. For instance to inform or warn deprecation of version of a package
- console.error() : show error message.
- console.table() : method display as a table on the console.
- console.time() : Start a timer you can use to track how long and operation takes.
- console.info() : It display information message on browser console.
- console.assert() : Writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false ans if the assertion is true, nothing happens.
- console.group() : Can help to group difference log group.
- console.count() : It prints the number of time this console.count() is called.
- console.clear() : clean the browser console

# Day 14 Error Handling
Javascript provides an error-handling  mechanism to cath runtime errors using-catch-finally block.

#### Syntax
            try{
             // code that may throw an error
            } catch(err){
             // code to be executed if an error occurs
            } finally{
             // code to be executed regardless of an error occurs or not
            }

try : the try statement allows us define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

catch : Catch block to use to log an error or display specific massages to the user.

finally : The finally block can be used to complete the remaining task or reset variable that might have changed before error occurred in try block.

### Example:
            let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
            let fullName = fistName + ' ' + lastName
            } catch (err) {
            console.log(err)
            }
